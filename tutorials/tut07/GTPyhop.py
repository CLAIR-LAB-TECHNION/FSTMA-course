    and GTPyhop won't use it unless the user declares it explicitly using
        declare_multigoal_methods(m_split_multigoal)

    The method's purpose is to try to achieve a multigoal by achieving each
    of the multigoal's individual goals sequentially. Parameters:
        - 'state' is the current state
        - 'multigoal' is the multigoal to achieve 

    If multigoal is true in the current state, m_split_multigoal returns
    []. Otherwise, it returns a goal list
        [g_1, ..., g_n, multigoal],

    where g_1, ..., g_n are all of the goals in multigoal that aren't true
    in the current state. This tells the planner to achieve g_1, ..., g_n
    sequentially, then try to achieve multigoal again. Usually this means
    m_split_multigal will be used repeatedly, until it succeeds in producing
    a state in which all of the goals in multigoal are simultaneously true.

    The main problem with m_split_multigoal is that it isn't smart about
    choosing the order in which to achieve g_1, ..., g_n. Some orderings may
    work much better than others. Thus, rather than using the method as it's
