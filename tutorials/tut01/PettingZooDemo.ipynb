    "[PettingZoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/) is a Python library for conducting research in multi-agent reinforcement learning, akin to a multi-agent version of [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). It implements a variety of environments, including:\n",
    "- [Atari](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/atari): Multi-player Atari 2600 games (cooperative, competitive and mixed sum)\n",
    "- [Butterfly](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/butterfly): Cooperative graphical games developed by us, requiring a high degree of coordination\n",
    "- [Classic](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/classic): Classical games including card games, board games, etc.\n",
    "- [MAgent](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/magent): Configurable environments with massive numbers of particle agents, originally from https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent\n",
    "- [MPE](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/mpe): A set of simple nongraphical communication tasks, originally from https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs\n",
    "- [SISL](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/sisl): 3 cooperative environments, originally from https://github.com/sisl/MADRL\n",

    "The [Simple Speaker Listener Environment](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/mpe/simple_speaker_listener) is implemented in the MPE library. It is a 2-agent environment in which one agent, the \"speaker\", has information about the goal and has a limmited mode of communication with the second agent, the \"listener\", which must use the speaker's communications and its limitted observations to navigate a 2D space toward the goal. The speaker agent cannot navigate, and the listener object cannot communicate.\n",

    "1. `max_cycles` - the number of actions each agent can perform before the end of the episode. _default=25_\n",

    "The environment object implements many usful tools to help understand and properly utilize the environment. Below we use the `agents` attribute toiterate over the agent names, and the `observation_space` and `action_space` functions to show the [gym spaces](https://gym.openai.com/docs/#spaces) for the agents observation and action spaces."

Both the speaker and the listener receive one dimensional `Box` observations of different sizes with any 32-bit floating point value. Note that the observation spaces remain the same regardless of the action space type (continuous / discrete). We can get the next acting agent's observation using the environment's `last` function, which returns the previous observation, reward, \"done\" flag, info dictionary. The current acting agent is chosen sequentially according to the agents' order in the `agents` attribute. The next agent is chosen when calling the `step` function which is sets the agent's action.\n",

    "We now define an environment with either a discrete or continuous action space that limits to a small number of steps, for the purposes of this demonstration, using the `max_cycles` parameter. We then create a policy for each agent and start iterating over them repeatedly. For this, the environment implements the `agent_iter` function. This function simply iterates over the list of agents `max_cycles` times, allowing us to perform `max_cycles` steps for each agent. An added bonus of using `agent_iter` is that it raises an error if there was no `step` call within the iteration (which can prevent horrible bugs). After the episode has ended, the agents' \"done\" status will be true, and . In this case the episode is complete and the environment must be reset if we wish to run it again."

    "PettingZoo provides utilities called wrappers. They are used to alter the behavior of the environment with minimal effort wihtout changing the general environment API. In fact, the Simple Speaker Listener environment already wrapped upon creation. In the below demonstration, we can see that the environment type is actually a wrapper called `OrderEnforcingWrapper`. This class works like the original environment and adds checks that enforce the agent order, and adds extra functionality, e.g. the `agent_iter` function is implemented in this wrapper (and is not available in the raw environment). The underlying environment, revealed using the environment's `env` attribute, is actually wrapped by another wrapper called `AssertOutOfBoundsWrapper`, which checks that given actions are compatible with the agents' discrete action space (similarly, the continuous action space uses another wrapper called `ClipOutOfBoundsWrapper`). Only under this wrapper do we find the raw environment object. However, we can jump directly to the raw environment by using the `unwrapped` property."

Many PettingZoo environments support acting in parallel using yet another wrapper, including Simple Speaker Listener. This is important for implementing algorithms that consider joint actions, e.g., centralized control. We can create a parallel environment by invoking the `parallel_env` function."
