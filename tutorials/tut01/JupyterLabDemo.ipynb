    "The [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language contains many science-oriented libraries such as `numpy` (a powerfull and efficient multi-dimensional array library), `matplotlib` (a fully stacked graphing and plotting library), and many more, making it great for interactive scientific coding. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a non-profit organization that builds open-source software for interactive scientific coding, accross many programming languages, through the use of web-UI that displays ipython notebooks, sometimes called jupyter notebooks, or simply `.ipynb` files. It is based on the [IPython project](https://ipython.org/), and supports python out of the box.\n",

We can edit python files, regular text files, and anything in between, with syntax highlighting supported for many files types including markdown (`.md`) YMAL (`.yml`) among others. The GUI functions as one would expect from an IDE, allowing us to resize panes, change fonts, tabbed file management, light and dark themes, and many other functionalities. There is even an extension manager for third party extensions that enhance customizability and functionality."
